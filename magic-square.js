/* We define a magic square to be an  n x n  matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2  where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length  is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.

You will be given a 3x3 matrix  of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9]. 
We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a - b|. 
Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range [1, 9].

******** FUNCTION DESCRIPTION **********

Complete the formingMagicSquare function in the editor below. 
It should return an integer that represents the minimal total cost of converting the input square to a magic square.

formingMagicSquare has the following parameter(s):

s: a 3 x 3 array of integers
Input Format

Each of the lines contains three space-separated integers of row .
